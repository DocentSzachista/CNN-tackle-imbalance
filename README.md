# MGU
Project for Deep Learning course. Its aim was to check chosen methods tackling data imbalance. 

## Used methods
- Show more often images that were of imbalanced class.
- Modify weights for function loss to give higher weights to imbalanced classes.
- Generate additional images by using SMOTE.

## Used Dataset:
We used CIFAR-10 dataset to first create three different imbalanced dataset scenarios and later train and test neural networks.

## Created imbalanced strategies
They can be found in `dataset_downloader.py`


## Used CNNs: 
- **ResNet101** from [here](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar)
- **Vgg16** from lecturer notebook.
